    "Using the skeleton's below (which are based off the ones from the notes), build off of these classes to implement the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "1.) A `Member` class where each `Member` has the following **attributes**:  \n",
    "* age - Integer\n",
    "* name - Sring\n",
    "* hair color - String \n",
    "* favorite color - String\n",
    "* programming experience - String (make this one have a default value if not passed in upon instantiation)\n",
    "* words - List of Strings (this will be set as an empty list to begin)\n",
    "* foods - List of Strings (this will be set as an empty list to begin)\n",
    "* notes - List of Strings (this will be set as an empty list to begin)\n",
    "\n",
    "and the following **methods** (see the docstrings in the skeleton): \n",
    "* speaks\n",
    "* eats \n",
    "* writes \n",
    "\n",
    "2.) A `Meetup` class where each `Meetup` has the following **attributes**: \n",
    "* members - list of all the members in the Meetup\n",
    "* names - list of all the members names in the Meetup\n",
    "\n",
    "and the following **methods** (see the docstrings in the skeleton code): \n",
    "* get_menu\n",
    "* get_notes\n",
    "* get_transcript\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) Instantiate a `Member` for each member in your group, and then create an instance of the `Meetup` class you have created and fill it with your members. Double check that all of your code works and does what you expect when you're finished. "
